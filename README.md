# WoWInfo

WoW Info is an App developed during the Maratona Xamarin Brasil in order to show what I've learned during the course;

Basically, the user can search for a specific character by name and realm and then the app display it's avatar and other informations such as
level, total honorable kills and etc.

## Features of the App
* Login with Social (Facebook), using Azure App Services
* Push Notification (Android only), using Azure App Services
* Blizzard BattleNet Api consumption (World of Warcraft)
